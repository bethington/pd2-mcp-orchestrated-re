## üîß Usage Examples

### Quick Static Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/analyze/pe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"binary_path": "/path/to/binary.exe"}'
```

### Comprehensive Analysis Pipeline
```bash
# Start comprehensive analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/analyze/binary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "binary_path": "/path/to/binary.exe",
    "analysis_depth": "comprehensive"
  }'

# Check progress
curl http://localhost:8001/analyze/status/{analysis_id}

# Get results
curl http://localhost:8001/analyze/result/{analysis_id}
```

### Ghidra Decompilation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/analyze/binary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "binary_path": "/path/to/binary.exe",
    "analysis_type": "comprehensive",
    "include_decompilation": true
  }'
```

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Analysis Speed
- **Static Analysis**: 30 seconds - 5 minutes depending on binary size
- **Ghidra Decompilation**: 5-15 minutes for comprehensive analysis
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Real-time with minimal performance impact

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Analyses**: Multiple binaries can be analyzed simultaneously
- **Background Processing**: Long analyses don't block the API
- **Resource Management**: Configurable memory and CPU limits

### Accuracy
